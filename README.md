# Game Off 2020 ~ Fruitshot
This is my repository for my Game Off 2020 submission, Fruitshot.

Fruitshot was made with Python 3.9 and Pygame 2.0.

Note that the code may be a bit wonky at times, but I hope it does give you an idea on how this game works.

I've also deleted the folders for the font and music because you're not allowed to distribute them online without
their creator's consent.

Well, have fun exploring the code I guess.
